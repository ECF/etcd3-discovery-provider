Bndtools Remote Service Workspace Template

NEW: [This is a video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqWTHB17Pc4) showing how to create a bndtools workspace for remote services development.

NOTE:  There is now a branch named minimal, which when provided as the branch for the workspace template as described in video and documentation below, will provide a *minimal* workspace template, with only a small subset of the workspace repos and project templates.   The minimal branch is useful to use for an initial exposure to [ECF Remote Services](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECF).

NOTE: There is a branch named grpc, which when provided as the branch for the workspace template as described in video and documentation below, will provide only the grpc workspace template. The grpc branch is useful to use for an initial exposure to ECF gRPC Remote Services Distribution Provider.

For more documentation about how to install/use this workspace template see here:  https://wiki.eclipse.org/Bndtools_Support_for_Remote_Services_Development
